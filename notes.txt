# What is React JS?
      React is the most popular javascript library for building user interfaces.

# Uses of React
ReactJS, a flexible JavaScript library, 
is widely used to create dynamic user interfaces. 
Its main application is in building single-page applications (SPAs), 
allowing smooth content updates without page reloads.


#JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension) or 
JavaScript XML. 
JSX is a combination of HTML and JavaScript.
We can embed JavaScript objects inside the HTML elements.
Error handling and warnings become easier to handle when using JSX.


#DOM
JavaScript Frameworks updates the whole DOM at once, which makes the web application slow
#Virtual DOM 
react uses virtual DOM and "updates only the modified parts".
So , this makes the DOM to run faster.

#Components:
React "divides" the "web page" into "multiple components" as it is component-based.
So the component logic which is written in JavaScript makes it easy and run faster and can be reusable.

#What are ReactJS Lifecycle Methods? 
#Initialization: This is the stage where the component is constructed with the given Props and default state. This is done in the constructor of a Component Class.
#Mounting: Mounting is the stage of rendering the JSX returned by the render method itself.
#Updating: Updating is the stage when the state of a component is updated and the application is repainted.
#Unmounting: As the name suggests Unmounting is the final step of the component lifecycle where the component is removed from the page.
